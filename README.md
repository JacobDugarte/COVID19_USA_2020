# COVID19_USA_2020
This repository presents an in-depth data analysis of COVID-19 in the United States throughout the year 2020. Explore comprehensive insights, visualizations, and findings that shed light on the pandemic's impact, regional disparities, and the correlation between cases and fatalities. Gain valuable insights into the complex dynamics of the COVID-19 crisis in the United States through data-driven analysis and compelling visual representations."

## Objective
The objective of this analysis was to gain insights into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States during 2020. It aimed to examine patterns, correlations, and regional variations in cases and deaths, providing a better understanding of the virus's effect on different states and regions. The analysis sought to contribute to our knowledge of the pandemic's dynamics and inform public health strategies and preparedness efforts.

## Data
Two datasets, namely covid_us_county.csv and us_county.csv, were made available by Johns Hopkins University and can be accessed for download on Kaggle. These datasets encompass data regarding the cumulative counts of COVID-19 cases and fatalities categorized by county and gender.

- covid_us_county.csv
- us_county.csv

## Folders
The COVID19 analysis was separated into the following folders:

- Project Management: Contains the Project Brief
- Data: Separated into Original and Prepared Data. These contain the original data frames and the data frames after they have been cleaned and prepared for analysis respectively. 
- Scripts: Contains all the Python coding involved for the entire analysis process
- Analysis: Contains the Visualizations used for developing insights and presenting on the final report

## Skills Demostrated
- Data Cleaning: We performed data cleaning tasks, which involved removing duplicates, addressing missing values, and rectifying mixed or erroneous data types.

- Data Merging: We carefully selected and prepared the data for merging, ensured the successful completion of the merge, and then exported the final merged dataset.

- Exploratory Data Analysis: In this phase, we conducted a comprehensive exploration of the data. We calculated basic descriptive statistics and correlation analysis for the variables of interest. Additionally, we utilized various data visualization techniques to gain insights into the data distributions.

- Creation of New Variables: We organized the data by state, date, cases, deaths and population to facilitate in-depth analysis at each level.

- Data Visualization: To effectively communicate our findings, we created a variety of visual representations, scatterplots, line charts, and both vertical and horizontal bar charts, as well as a viualizazion storyboard in Tableau
